### 4. Enjoy using the multimode calculator!

Once everything is set up, you're ready to use the calculator in all of its modes (Standard, Scientific, Computer, and Currency Converter).

## Modes Overview

### 1. Standard Mode  
This mode offers basic operations:  
- Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`)

### 2. Scientific Mode  
Advanced calculations, including:  
- Trigonometry functions: sin, cos, tan  
- Logarithms: log
- Exponents: x^y, square root, and other power operations  

### 3. Computer Mode  
Convert and calculate between different number systems:  
- Binary (0 and 1)  
- Octal (0-7)  
- Decimal (0-9)  
- Hexadecimal (0-9, A-F)

### 4. Currency Converter  
Convert between different currencies using static exchange rates. The conversion rates are predefined and do not update in real-time, reducing complexity. By default, the amount has to be entered in USD (United States Dollar), then it's converted into other currencies. Supported currencies include:
